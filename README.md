### Author Declaration
This complete end-to-end pipeline (SQL relational layer, Pandas cleaning & EDA, visualizations, and GenAI narrative with offline fallback) was independently designed, implemented, tested and documented by **Amarjit Kahlon** as the Capstone Project for the program **Data Analytics with AI & GenAI – E&ICT Academy, IIT Roorkee**.

All logic, numbers and outputs were generated and verified by the author against the provided seed data.

One public GitHub repository. Every number in this brief is produced by running the three layers below against the committed seed data.

## How the three layers connect

1. **SQL layer** loads the same CSVs into SQLite and answers relational questions on the *raw* 180 rows (gross revenue ₹99,860.20).
2. **Python layer** re-reads the same CSVs, cleans them (payment casing, 5 duplicates, imputations, IQR flags), and writes verified numbers to `narrator/findings.json` (cleaned revenue ₹97,358.30).
3. **GenAI layer** reads *only* `findings.json` and produces an SCR narrative (online Gemini or offline template). No layer invents a number the previous layer did not compute.

## 1. SQL layer — schema, seed, reports

Requires SQLite 3 (or any engine that accepts the syntax in `schema.sql`).

```bash
# Create empty DB and apply schema
sqlite3 mamaearth.db < sql/schema.sql

# Load seed (45 customers, 16 products, 180 orders)
sqlite3 mamaearth.db < sql/seed_data.sql

# Sanity counts
sqlite3 mamaearth.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;"   # → 45
sqlite3 mamaearth.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;"    # → 16
sqlite3 mamaearth.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;"      # → 180

# Run all Task 3 reports (a–i); expected outputs are comments above each query
sqlite3 mamaearth.db < sql/reports.sql
```

If you use `.import` instead of `seed_data.sql`, run after import:

```sql
UPDATE orders SET discount_pct = NULL WHERE discount_pct = '';
UPDATE orders SET rating = NULL WHERE rating = '';
```

---

## 2. Python analysis layer — clean, EDA, charts, findings.json

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib

# Task 1–10 of Part 2; also writes narrator/findings.json (Part 3 Task 1)
python analysis/clean_and_eda.py

# Task 11 — regenerates the two PNGs under visualizations/
python analysis/visualize.py
```

`clean_and_eda.py` prints every intermediate acceptance value (shape, payment counts, dropped order_ids, median rating, cleaned total ₹97,358.30, reconciliation paragraph, IQR bounds, return rates, segmentation, correlations, both monthly series).  
`findings.json` is written by this script — never hand-typed — so it cannot drift from Part 2.

---

## 3. GenAI narrative layer — online or offline

```bash
# Offline path (no API key) — deterministic SCR template, always gradable
python narrator/generate_narrative.py

# Online path — free Gemini key from Google AI Studio
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-free-key-here"
python narrator/generate_narrative.py
```

- **With `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) set**: calls `google-genai` with `temperature=0.0`, explicit `max_output_tokens`, and timeout ≥ 10s; returns a structured `{status, narrative, tokens}` dict; on any failure falls back offline.
- **With no key**: runs `generate_scr_narrative_offline` only.

Both paths write `narrator/sample_output.txt` and run the Task 5 numeric accuracy checker (pass/fail line per figure). The grader verifies the saved sample, not a live API call.

Optional dependency for the online path only:

```bash
pip install google-genai
```

## Key verified figures

| Figure | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Raw total revenue (Part 1) | 99,860.20 |
| Cleaned total revenue (Part 2) | 97,358.30 |
| Duplicate reconciliation delta | 2,501.90 |
| COD / CARD / UPI return rates | 44.4% / 14.7% / 18.9% |
| Highest-risk segment | COD + Tier-2 at 54.5% |
| True peak month (outlier-corrected) | March 20,318.90 |
